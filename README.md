# EP-630

The EP-630 are great earphones but after using them for 2 weeks you can't know which side is the right and which side is the left.
So I've made this small script to help me check.

# DOESN'T WORK

The first time you launch the workflow OS X will ask you to allow Alfred2 to play with the Accessibility features. You have to allow.
If it still doesn't work it might be because I've coded that on a Saturday.

# WHY DOES IT OPEN THE SYSTEM PREFERENCES WHEN I LUNCH THE WORKFLOW

First it's *launch*, not *lunch.
Second, I haven't found the way to change the audio balance without the UI, but I keep reading that it's impossible.
But the window will close automatically at the end of the process. Close your eyes if you don't want to see it.

# THE DESCRIPTION SUCKS, THE KEYWORD SUCKS. IT ALL SUCKS.
You can change all of that. And also go fuck yourself.

# I HATE YOU
Please queue.
